Write an app that notifies students when class is canceled. 

This was one of the challenges for a Hackathon at lehman college. My team and I wanted to create an app that queries a given school's database for a student or professors given schedule and allow them to send a notice for a canceled class to their entire roster with ease. In turn students would be able to send a message to their professors if they can't make it to class. These messgaes would be automated via an api called Twillio which allows users to send sms, email, and tweets via social media.
